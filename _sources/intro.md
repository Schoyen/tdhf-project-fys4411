Time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory
==================================

This is a project on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock method applied to a system
of two one-dimensional quantum dots for the course [FYS4411
(2021)](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS4411/v21/) at the
University of Oslo.
We will base the project around the paper: {cite}`zanghellini_2004`.
Below follows a list of tasks that needs to be completed for the project.

## Project tasks:
1. Set up the single-particle basis set.
2. Create a general Hartree-Fock (GHF) ground-state solver.
3. Compute the GHF ground-state energy, particle density, and dipole moment.
4. Create a time-dependent general Hartree-Fock (TDGHF) solver, and add a
   time-dependent monochromatic dipole laser-field interaction term to the
   Hamiltonian.
5. Compute the time-dependent overlap and the time-dependent dipole moment. Plot
   the results.
6. Optional: Run a simulation with a laser pulse, and plot the Fourier spectra
   of the overlap and the dipole moment after the pulse is turned off.
