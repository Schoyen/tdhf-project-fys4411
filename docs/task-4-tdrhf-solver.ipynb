    "# Task 4: Time-dependent restricted Hartree-Fock solver\n",
    "\n",
    "Having constructed and solved the restricted Hartree-Fock ground state problem, we now set out to shine a monochromatic dipole laser on the system.\n",
    "This means appending a time-dependent operator to the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "The operator describes a semi-classical electric field in the dipole approximation in the length gauge.\n",
    "For a more thorough discussion of this operator check out chapters 2 - 2.4 in {cite}`joachain2012atoms`.\n",
    "The operator will in the one-dimensional case be described by\n",

    "where $\\hat{d} \\equiv q\\hat{x}$ is the dipole moment operator with $q = -1$ the electron charge, and $f(t)$ the time-dependent laser field.\n",
    "From {cite}`zanghellini_2004` we have $f(t) = \\mathcal{E}_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$, (note that $\\omega$ is not necessarily the same as the harmonic oscillator well frequency) which describes a monochromatic laser field that is always active."
