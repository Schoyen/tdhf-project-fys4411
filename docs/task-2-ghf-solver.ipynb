    "We will also adhere to this convention, thus making the basis of harmonic oscillator single-particle functions the atomic orbitals of our system.\n",
    "Now, as the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian is independent of spin we have restricted our view to the spatial part of the atomic orbitals when using quantum-systems to construct our basis elements.\n",
    "However, when moving to the full fermionic many-body picture (two = many) we have to include spin to get the full picture.\n",
    "We often talk about three kinds of orbitals depending on the restrictions put on spin.\n",

    "    where $\\varphi_i(x)$ are the spatial oribtals, and $\\sigma \\in \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}$ are spin basis functions with $m_s \\in \\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$ the spin quantum number.\n",

    "        = \\varphi_{\\sigma}(x) \\sigma(m_s),\n",
    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "    where an unrestricted spin-orbital has a definite spin-direction (either $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$), but allows for the spatial part to be different between spin-directions.\n",

    "We will in this project create a general Hartree-Fock (GHF) solver which implies that we use general spin-orbitals.\n",
    "This will turn out to be easiest mathematically (when deriving the equations for GHF) and the most general formulation.\n",
