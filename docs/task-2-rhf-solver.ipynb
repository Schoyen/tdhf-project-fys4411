    "Before proceeding, we need to decide on which type of single-particle functions, and hence which type of Hartree-Fock method, we intend to use. In particular, we need to decide on how we wish to treat spin. We will be looking at two electrons with spin $1/2$, and as the Hamiltonian in equation {eq}`eq:hamiltonian` is independent of spin, we know that the \"true\" ground state will be a singlet state. However, as we are working with an approximation to the full ground state wave function it is not necessarily guaranteed that our solution will be an eigenstate of the $\\hat{S}^2$-operator. For spin $s = 1/2$ we have the two spin-$z$ projections $m_s = \\pm 1/2$. We will for brevity denote the two orthonormal spin-states as $| \\sigma \\rangle = | s, m_s \\rangle$ with $| 0 \\rangle = | 1/2, +1/2 \\rangle$ for spin up and $| 1 \\rangle = | 1/2, -1/2 \\rangle$ for spin down. To be able to control the spin symmetry of the problem we typically look at three different kinds of orbitals.\n",

    "The naming can be a bit misleading, but it is related to the three most common types of Hartree-Fock approximations. \n",
    "For the general Hartree-Fock method (GHF) using general spin-orbitals we only care about the energy. This means that the Hartree-Fock ground state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ does not need to be an eigenstate of $\\hat{S}_z$ nor $\\hat{S}^2$. The unrestricted Hartree-Fock method (UHF) using unrestricted spin-orbitals will give a ground state that is an eigenstate of $\\hat{S}_z$, but not $\\hat{S}^2$ in general. Finally, the restricted Hartree-Fock method (RHF) using restricted spin-orbitals ensures that the wave function is an eigenstate of both $\\hat{S}_z$ and $\\hat{S}^2$. For two particles the RHF method will give a singlet ground state.\n",
